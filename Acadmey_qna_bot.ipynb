            "['In this section well discuss tierbased loyalty programs and their importance for brands Many brands prefer to set up tierbased loyalty programs because they are easy for customers to understand and join A crucial concept in tierbased loyalty programs is RFM which stands for Recency Frequency and Monetary value RFM helps brands categorize customers based on how recently they made a purchase how often they shop and how much they spend This concept is like a secret sauce for tierbased loyalty programs allowing brands to segment their customer base effectively Customer differentiation is key for brands Treating all customers the same way isnt ideal Active highspending customers should receive special treatment and rewards while nonactive customers require a different strategy to encourage their return to the store Tier strategies involve creating different tiers naming them creatively and grouping customers accordingly Eligibility criteria for each tier are established as well as the requirements to move up to the next tier Benefits attached to each tier can also be set up encouraging customers to spend more for greater rewards To prevent customers from staying in a tier indefinitely validity clauses can be attached Depending on conditions like customer visits or purchases validity can be extended A sample brand strategy might involve tiers like Silver Gold and Diamond Customers move up tiers by meeting spending thresholds and benefits increase with each tier Creating an effective tierbased loyalty program involves two main steps grouping customers into tiers and awarding different benefits based on tiers The first step grouping customers is covered in this section The second step awarding benefits is explored in the next section To create tiers on a loyalty platform you navigate through the setup process Different options for eligibility criteria and upgrade types are available Eligibility criteria include options like current points lifetime points lifetime purchases and tracker value Upgrade types determine how points are allocated and customers are upgraded based on transactions at the border of two tiers Secondary criteria can be added for more specific requirements Validity periods are set to define how long customers can stay in a tier After a certain time renewal conditions determine whether customers can extend their membership Downgrade criteria and renewal settings provide flexibility in managing tier validity Tier strategies are crucial for customer segmentation engagement and loyalty They offer benefits to both customers and brands encouraging spending and loyalty while ensuring customer differentiation Why are tiers important for generating loyalty among customers For customers As customers shop more and more with a brand they get more incentives as and when they go up through tiers For companies Incentivizing the most loyal customers more than others would generate more goodwill and loyalty among customers and hence generate more revenue Who should care about it The Loyalty Program Manager needs to use tiers to achieve loyalty outcomes with the end customer The System Integrator and Delivery Executive need to set up the tiers which can be a complex process and add modifications as and when required What are the marketing benefits of having tiers in loyalty programs Tiers help with optimizing the markets brand and setting up the right perception Better customers would want more rewards and the marketing manager would want more money to target better customers so that the ROI can be maximized Glossary Tier Upgrade Customers tier is upgraded according to the conditions set in the strategy or action Tier Downgrade Customers tier is downgraded according to the conditions set in the strategy or action Tier Upgrade Customers tier is renewed according to the conditions set in the strategy or action Tracker Trackers are a powerful tool to track custom values over a specific period You can use trackers for Eligibility and Renewal strategies and also in Workflows for certain milestones The custom values are bill amount gross bill amount lineitem count lineitem quantity line item price and customer visits You can create tracker strategies and define rule sets based on these custom values MLPs MultiLoyalty Programs enable orgs with multiple brands to run a separate loyalty program for each of its org units besides maintaining a single profile of a customer and also for centralized reporting     You cannot add a new tier in between two existing tiers and you also  cannot delete an already existing tier Create tiers and configure tier upgrade conditions You can configure each tier with a color of your preference To create and configure tiers follow these steps On INTOUCH navigate to Menu  LOYALTY  PROGRAMS In PROGRAMS select the program you want to edit Click EDIT PROGRAM 1026 Create a BASE TIER Navigate to the TIERS tab You will see a default or base tier Click the EDIT icon to modify the name of the tier 227 Name the tier 340 Describe the tier in brief 331 Select an appropriate color for the tier if required 247     You cannot set conditions for the default tier Click DONE to save Create more tiers and configure tier upgrade conditions From the second tier that you create you need to configure the eligibility criteria for the tier upgrade and define the upgrade condition for each tier This needs to be done by going to the Advanced Settings tab     The eligibility criteria type that you set for tier upgrade  remains the

set it will consider  from the 1st of that month Hence in the preceding example even if  the date is Oct 21 2018 it will consider Oct 1 2018 as the start  date for the tier validity period Configure renewal conditions You can renew a customers tier after the validity period by defining certain conditions To configure conditions for tier renewal do the following In CREATE NEW TIER after configuring the tier validity enable SET RENEWAL Conditions 485 Enable PURCHASES and enter the purchase value     The customer has to make a transaction for the configured amount  within the validity period 234 Enable NO OF VISITS and enter the number of visits that the customer has to make within the validity period of the tier 214 Enable POINTS EARNED and enter the number of points that the customer needs to earn within the validity period     Tier renewal happens if any of the when conditions enabled are  satisfied For example if you set purchases  1000 and Points  earned  10 A customers tier is downgraded only if all the  conditions are not satisfied if any one of the conditions are true  tier will be renewed 219 Click DONE View Tier Configuration You can view configured slabs in Tiers The first slab is the default slab and in the second slab you can see the eligibility criteria which is the same for all tiers along with conditions that were configured Each slab is interconnected which shows the sequential flow the arrow also leads to downgrading information displaying the downgrade condition 443 Validity Settings in Advanced Settings for Tiers Check tier expiry on a daily basis By default the validity of tiers is checked on the last day of the validity period month If you dont want that to happen this setting can be checked yes for the validity check to happen on the last day of the expiry itself rather than the last day of the respective month Validate for downgrade condition to a return transaction This setting only works if the transaction that caused the upgrade to happen gets returned and downgrade if applicable according to renewal conditions will happen at the end of the day Known shortcomings to this setting are one if a transaction which did not cause the upgrade is returned the downgrade does not happen and two the checks only happen at the end of the day so a customer can theoretically make a big transaction to gain the benefits from a better tier and then return the items to go back to their original tier and there will be no drawbacks to them in the process 3Extend available points to the next cycle This setting is applicable for all points expiry conditions which are configured to expire basis Tier based expiry date NOTE Renewal or Upgrade can also be done forcibly by using the Renew Tier or Upgrade to Tier action respectively this supports User Group Loyalty also You can select the slab to upgrade when configuring these actions It sets the same validity as the program configured but here the upgrade happens without the customer actually reaching the milestones But further renewals then happen according to the program configuration You cant set a custom validity or renewal condition using this thus nobody can have individualdifferent validity periods or renewal conditions across the program The settings for everyone in the program are the same So upgrades done by strategy actions or import result in the same condition for the customer Renewals using this action extend validity as per the configuration done in the program There is an event called Tier gets upgraded which gets triggered whenever a customers tier is upgraded due to an action If your basis for upgrading is points it could trigger in nontransactional events as well but if its a tracker or lifetime purchase it only triggers in transactional events This event has an action called Upgrade using tier different from the upgrade tier action Also the expression should be true And if this action is not present the upgrades due to strategy would also not work Use Cases Airline Industry Airlines can create loyalty programs to reward members with points they can use for flights or with their partners These programs can have tiers for example silver gold and platinum To qualify for any of these tiers a member must earn a specific number of points in a calendar year or take a set number of flights For example to qualify for the silver tier the easiest tier to achieve a member must earn 35000 points in a calendar year or fly 20 flights QSRs Restaurants can create loyalty programs that can be primarily used through their app making it convenient for members Special inapp offers can be configured which are sent as push notifications and emails so people know when theyre eligible for a reward Tiers can again be used in this industry to provide better incentives to the better customers for example free appetizers free delivery or better discounts Fashion Industry Fashion brands can create rewards programs with tiers based on how much members spend within a year the basic program can be free to join while a subscription program can also be set up Progressing to higher tiers shells more points earned per dollar and better rewards Purchases earn you a certain number of points per level and these points can be redeemed for rewards  trialsize and fullsize beauty products of your choice including exclusive products nonmembers cant access Members can also receive a choice of birthday gifts and depending on their threshold they can even gain access to exclusive events and experiences Integrations There are no APIs which can be used to change tiers for a customer externally right now We can use fetch APIs which can be used to get tier information of a customer Also light APIs are also used to get the most importantrelevant part of the customers tier dynamics quickly If the customer is in the base tier no expiry date is required and if in the top tier the next tier number is set to 1 The system can calculate the gap to upgrade and the gap to renew parameters for customers which are aimed to get the information on the gap or value of the tier upgrade parameter used which is yet to be allocated to upgrade the customers current tier But this is an addon feature so please raise a request to get this activated and only then can it be used for the org You can read about importing data for tiersslabs here FAQs Can I add a tier in between two existing tiers You cannot add a tier between two existing tiers A new tier is always an upgrade to the last tier If it is highly required to add a tier in between two tiers contact your Capillary PoC The Capillary Admin needs to perform the following steps Edit all the tiers from where you need to modify Change rule expressions and conditions Do a data clean up Reconfigure the loyalty program Can I change the points allocation type of an existing tier When you create a tier it shows the default points allocation type  prorated  of the transaction amount To change the points allocation type create a new points allocation strategy Then on the EVENTSVIEW page modify the action for the TRANSACTIONADD event by replacing the existing Transaction Points Allocation strategy with the new strategy Save the changes and Reconfigure the loyalty program to reflect the changes in the live program How are tiers structured in an MLP Tiers are independent across programs in an MLP Each program can have different numbers of tiers Can different tiers have different eligibility criteria The eligibility criteria that you set for tier upgrade remains the same for all the subsequent tiers that you create What happens to the status of my customer if heshe does not fulfill any of the tier eligibility criteria By default the customer will be in the base tier of the program Does each of the renewal conditions have to be met or any one of them is enough As of now its an or condition so either of those conditions will result in a renewal Will changing eligibility force the tiers to compute the settings for all users in advanced settings Yes it depends on the tier evaluation cycle Can I set an action in the workflows to send a communication to the customer after I retain the customer tier based on conditions such as at least 10 visits or 1000 points even if the customer has not met the tier criteria Yes that action can be set in the workflows Is it possible to upgrade tiers by using any other means apart from the usual upgrade conditions like a coupon or passing the points rule As of now you can do this manually through member care When I configure 26K points to upgrade a tier say Gold will it consider 26000 points or 26001 to qualify When configuring a tier you will only see upgrade rules greater than or equal to  Hence a customer with 26000 points or more will be in the Gold tier']\n"

              "'In this section well discuss tierbased loyalty programs and their importance for brands Many brands prefer to set up tierbased loyalty programs because they are easy for customers to understand and join A crucial concept in tierbased loyalty programs is RFM which stands for Recency Frequency and Monetary value RFM helps brands categorize customers based on how recently they made a purchase how often they shop and how much they spend This concept is like a secret sauce for tierbased loyalty programs allowing brands to segment their customer base effectively Customer differentiation is key for brands Treating all customers the same way isnt ideal Active highspending customers should receive special treatment and rewards while nonactive customers require a different strategy to encourage their return to the store Tier strategies involve creating different tiers naming them creatively and grouping customers accordingly Eligibility criteria for each tier are established as well as the requirements to move up to the next tier Benefits attached to each tier can also be set up encouraging customers to spend more for greater rewards To prevent customers from staying in a tier indefinitely validity clauses can be attached Depending on conditions like customer visits or purchases validity can be extended A sample brand strategy might involve tiers like Silver Gold and Diamond Customers move up tiers by meeting spending thresholds and benefits increase with each tier Creating an effective tierbased loyalty program involves two main steps grouping customers into tiers and awarding different benefits based on tiers The first step grouping customers is covered in this section The second step awarding benefits is explored in the next section To create tiers on a loyalty platform you navigate through the setup process Different options for eligibility criteria and upgrade types are available Eligibility criteria include options like current points lifetime points lifetime purchases and tracker value Upgrade types determine how points are allocated and customers are upgraded based on transactions at the border of two tiers Secondary criteria can be added for more specific requirements Validity periods are set to define how long customers can stay in a tier After a certain time renewal conditions determine whether customers can extend their membership Downgrade criteria and renewal settings provide flexibility in managing tier validity Tier strategies are crucial for customer segmentation engagement and loyalty They offer benefits to both customers and brands encouraging spending and loyalty while ensuring customer differentiation Why are tiers important for generating loyalty among customers For customers As customers shop more and more with a brand they get more incentives as and when they go up through tiers For companies Incentivizing the most loyal customers more than others would generate more goodwill and loyalty among customers and hence generate more revenue Who should care about it The Loyalty Program Manager needs to use tiers to achieve loyalty outcomes with the end customer The System Integrator and Delivery Executive need to set up the tiers which can be a complex process and add modifications as and when required What are the marketing benefits of having tiers in loyalty programs Tiers help with optimizing the markets brand and setting up the right perception Better customers would want more rewards and the marketing manager would want more money to target better customers so that the ROI can be maximized Glossary Tier Upgrade Customers tier is upgraded according to the conditions set in the strategy or action Tier Downgrade Customers tier is downgraded according to the conditions set in the strategy or action Tier Upgrade Customers tier is renewed according to the conditions set in the strategy or action Tracker Trackers are a powerful tool to track custom values over a specific period You can use trackers for Eligibility and Renewal strategies and also in Workflows for certain milestones The custom values are bill amount gross bill amount lineitem count lineitem quantity line item price and customer visits You can create tracker strategies and define rule sets based on these custom values MLPs MultiLoyalty Programs enable orgs with multiple brands to run a
